How do you want to do this?

When the target's HP is reaching 0 because of a player Actor action, the GM will get a pop-up message and the Midi workflow is paused until the message is resolved. This gives time for the GM to describe the demise of a boss, or any NPC actually. The GM can simply close it in case they want nothing to do with the situation and the Midi workflow will continue.
The message will only trigger if Auto damage is turned on in Midi Config.
The message will only trigger if the Actor is a Player, will not trigger on NPCs

Prerequisites:
- MidiQoL
- libWrapper
